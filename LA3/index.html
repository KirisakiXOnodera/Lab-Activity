                <p>Loid is a handsome man with short blond hair, blue eyes, and light skin. His hair is often slicked back to varying degrees, 
                    depending on the occasion. He is quite tall, with a slim but athletic build.</p>
                    <p>
                        Befitting of a spy, his true personality is rather cold and methodical, doing whatever it takes to complete the mission, from joining terrorist organizations to dating a target's daughter to becoming a father. 
                        However, he has a kind personality that reveals itself when he defends his family, even at the risk of his mission.
                        Loid's title as Westalis's greatest spy is quite deserved. His skills, both physical and mental, are second to none. He is able to effortlessly disarm an army of well-trained spies and ice-cold under pressure, able to calmly analyze any given situation and create a plan in seconds. He can not only figure out an entire person's personality and develop a tailored list of answers to any question they could ask, but can keep track of that list in his mind, as well as an extensive number of codes. 
                        However, his fake family's unpredictable nature and shenanigans give him a run for his money.
